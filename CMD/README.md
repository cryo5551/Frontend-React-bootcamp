#### Introduction
- My Name is Aayush Sinha,
- I Tech Lead based out of Bangalore.
- 7+ years of experience.
- Pretty much anything in JS.
- Prerequisite
- https://git-scm.com/download/win


### Command Line Interface(CLI)
- This is a text-based interface. Here, every command that we run, we will have to type it out.
The machine will execute whatever instruction we have given and then give output in terms of text.
- Examples, Bash, Terminal, Command Prompt, ZSH, SH, etc. etc.

### Graphical User Interface
- Instead of typing everything, we make better use of the screen and have buttons and element on which we can click and interact.

- Show the items in my folder (directory).
- (Windows) dir -> Short for directory command
- (Linux) ls -> Short for list command -> Alternative ll

- Knowing where you are.
- (Windows) No need, pretty good already
- ( Linux) pwd -> Print Working Directory -> This will show the currect directory in which we are.

**Note: Windows uses \ for the directory structure while Linux/Unix uses / for their directory structure**

### Navigation between directories
- (Windows | Linux) cd -> Short for change directory.
- To enter a directory.
- Usage: cd <directory_name>

- In Windows, when running cd, we can ignore the casing, windows will try to auto pick. In Linux, we cannot do that. In general, we should care about casing.

- Two dots to go to the parent ..
- Usage: cd ..
- DO NOT USE cd.. ❌
- To go multiple levels in, you put directory/another_directory/child. (On windows, use ).
- For 2 or more (cd ../../..) Single dot, cd . -> Refers to the current directory. 

#### Ctrl + C -> Cancel

### Clearing up the screen.
- (Windows) cls -> Short for Clear Screen
- (Linux) clear -> It means clear the screen.

### Creating a new Directory
- (Windows | Linux) mkdir -> Short for make directory.
- This needs the directory name. Try to avoid spaces as much as possible.
- In a case where it is needed to have space in the directory name, put that name iside quotation marks.
- To create hidden folders, start their name with a .(dot)

- [For Windows Only] - Changing / Navigating between drives.
- Just type the drive letter followed by colon.
- Usage -> C:
- Usage -> D:

- Food for Thought - What will happen if I have 26 pendrives already attached, taking A-Z colons and then I plug in 27th pendrive?

- Note: Tab is for auto complete

### vi
- This is a text Editor.
- vi runs on modes.
- To go to default mode, press Esc.
- To exit, there is command :q (q -> quit)
- If you changed something and don't want to save, then it is :q! (! -> override)
- If you have changed something and want to save it, then it is :w (w -> write)
- To go to insert mode, we press I.

### Manual (man)
- This is used to get information about any command.
- (Windows) info or help -> This will get information for any command.
- tail | head
- Tail will print the last 10 lines of any file.
- Head will print the first 10 lines of any file.
- Specially for large fules, we don't want to load it in the memory.
- These will just print the content without loading the file in memory.

### cat
- Displays the file contents in the terminal.
- We cannot edit this information.
- This is only READ-able.
- (Windows) type -> Usage: type <file_name>


### Deletion
- Delete a file

- (Windows) del -> Short for delete
- Usage: del <file_name>
- (Linux) rm -> Short for Remove
- Usage: rm <file_name>

- Be careful, there might not be any recycle bin to recover from.

### Delete a directory

- (Windows) rmdir -> Short for Remove Directory
- (Linux) rm -rf -> Short for remove --recursive --force
