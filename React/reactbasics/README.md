## Getting Started with Create React App

## ReactJS
- Its a frontend library.
- frontend -> for the clients(web browsers).
- library - A set of code written (classes and function bundled together to make your work easy as doveloper)

### Library and framework
- React (Library) vs Angular(Framework)
- Library is small in size.
- Framework is big in size.
- React is faster compared to Angular and other framework.
- In a framework, many things are built in.
- In a library, it only contains the basics.
  - Example:
   - In React, API calles are not thetre, we import and axios. There is no routing by default, we need to use react-router.
   - In angular, all these things are built-in.
   - It always add to the size.
 - Librarys contains only bare minimum that you need to get started. Anything extra, you need to install seperately.


## Directory Structure
- in <project_name>
- inside this projct we have diffrent files and directories.
 - node_modules - This ia a directory which contains all the modules/packages that were using.this is a really big folder, we never share it. These packages are important for brtter execution / development of react Application.

 - public - This directory contains things that are to be shown to the public.
  - favicon - this is the icon shown next to the title.
  - index.html - This is the main file.
  - logo - This is the logo file which we might use in project.
  - manifest.json - More like a metadata for website.

 - src - This contains the source code. Whatever we customize is going to be inside this.
 - .gitignore
 - package.json
 - package-lock.json
 - READDME.md
