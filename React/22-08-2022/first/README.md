# Getting Started with Create React App

## Start
- Getting started with NPM Approach

### NPM Approach

- crewat a new directry
- inside that directry, open the terminal / CMD
- run the command, `npx create-react-app first`
- this will take some time and create a react directry
- go in that bu using cd first
- now to start the server,(To start the  frontend display)
- use: npm start 
- cammand in cmd/ git bash

**alternative approach use sandbox.io(Browser only free service)**
- recommended to those who have low spec machine.



### Node.js
- It is a software used to Execute JS outside of a browser.
- It is a open source, cross-platform, Runtime envirement for javascript.
- alternatives:
  - DenoJS
  - BunJS

### NPM (node package manager)
- In JS, there is a concept of Modules.
- These modules can be converted to packages.
- Packages are third party developed JS code that we can just install, import and use.
- This saves us time as we don't need to re-invent the wheel.
- Now, we are dependent on that package.
- NPMJS is a directory of all the packages. It contains the list, then the description, github connections, download info, etc etc.
- Node Package Manager
- If I am creating/working on any application, I might need some packages to help me (to prevent from reinventing the wheel). Now, these packages which I need to add, I also need a way to add/manage them. NPM is that way.
- NPM helps me add and manage any additional package that I need for my application.

### Task:
- Create a react application and in the HTML, create a basic about me page. No need of any fancy CSS for now. Just the html basic is okay.
