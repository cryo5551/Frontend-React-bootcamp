# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Start
- Getting started with NPM Approach

### NPM Approach

- crewat a new directry
- inside that directry, open the terminal / CMD
- run the command, `npx create-react-app first`
- this will take some time and create a react directry
- go in that bu using cd first
- now to start the server,(To start the  frontend display)
- use: npm start 
- cammand in cmd/ git bash

**alternative approach use sandbox.io(Browser only free service)**
- recommended to those who have low spec machine.



### Node.js
- It is a software used to Execute JS outside of a browser.
- It is a open source, cross-platform, Runtime envirement for javascript.
- alternatives:
  - DenoJS
  - BunJS

### NPM (node package manager)
- In JS, there is a concept of Modules.
- These modules can be converted to packages.
- Packages are third party developed JS code that we can just install, import and use.
- This saves us time as we don't need to re-invent the wheel.
- Now, we are dependent on that package.
- NPMJS is a directory of all the packages. It contains the list, then the description, github connections, download info, etc etc.
- Node Package Manager
- If I am creating/working on any application, I might need some packages to help me (to prevent from reinventing the wheel). Now, these packages which I need to add, I also need a way to add/manage them. NPM is that way.
- NPM helps me add and manage any additional package that I need for my application.

### Task:
- Create a react application and in the HTML, create a basic about me page. No need of any fancy CSS for now. Just the html basic is okay.
