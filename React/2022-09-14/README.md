## Units of Measurement

### em
- This is also a reference to font-size.

- This is a relative reference to font-size, but we can use it anywhere.

### vh vs vw
- vh is for the height of the viewport - viweport height
- vw is for the width of the viewport - viewport width
- This is a percentage value. 100vh means 100% of the height of viewport.
- This refers to the global viewport.

### %

### cm/in
- This refers to the real world scale of 1 cm or 1 inch.

### box-shadow
- This is used to give shadow to the element.
- It takes 4 things:
  - x offset, how much shadow we want on the x axis.
  - y offset, how much shadow we want on th ey axis.
  - blur radius, higher is more blur, 0 is solid.
  - color of the shadow.
